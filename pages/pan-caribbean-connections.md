# Pan-Caribbean Connections


The Spanish Empire considered Cuba its most precious possession in the Caribbean, not only for its strategic location but also for its sugar plantations. After the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) Cuba became the paragon of sugar production and a bastion of slavery and colonial rule.

Given the importance of sugar in the colonial economy, Cuban insurgents (called mambises) burned many sugar cane fields and sugar mills along the island. This guerrilla tactic was also used in other Caribbean countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic before being adopted in Cuba.

Máximo Gómez (1836-1905), a Dominican general and one of the most important leaders of the Cuban independence movement made this technique a cornerstone of his guerilla warfare style. Along with Gómez, Antonio Maceo (1848-1896), another leader and general in the rebel army, successfully deployed that tactic and the feared ‘machete charge’  against the Spaniards. 
The warfare tactics, the exchange of ideas, and the collaboration of leaders from several Caribbean countries (often located in different geographical locations) talk of the rich independence movement that irradiated from the Caribbean and its diaspora.

Another example of this Pan-Caribbean connection was the presence of Juan Rius Rivera (1848-1924), a Puerto Rican revolutionary leader, who fought along with Cubans and became a general in the rebel army.

One of the Chocolates Juncosa’s trade cards portrays Rius Rivera, albeit we can’t distinguish him, being injured and captured by the Spaniards. This type of erasure and misrepresentation is repeated throughout the collection. The most problematic one is the number 10, in which we see the alleged deaths of Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo. The truth is that they died in different places and years apart from each other. Maceo died in combat on December 7th,1896 during a military campaign in the west part of Cuba while Gómez was in the eastern part of the island. His death was a heavy blow to the Cuban forces and a very personal one for Máximo Gómez. Francisco ‘Panchito’ Gómez Toro (1876-1896) was Maceo’s military aide-de-camp and Gómez’s son, who also died that day fighting next to Maceo.

In his Diario de Campaña/Campaign Diary, Máximo Gómez describes December 16th, 1896 as “El dia mas triste para mi''/the saddest day for me (p.315), a reference to the date when he receives the news of his son and Maceo’s death.  What makes this quotation relevant is how perfectly it illustrates the personal toll of the war and provides us with a more human perspective of a heroic figure. 
In many ways, Maceo’s death became a theme of symbolic reference in the Cuban imagination. After the birth of the Cuban Republic in 1902, the artist and former independence fighter Armando Garcia Menocal (1863-1942) painted La muerte de Maceo/ The death of Maceo  in 1906. Menocal’s masterpiece serves as a visual and symbolic counterpoint to the portrayal of Maceo’s death in the Chocolates Juncosa collection.
