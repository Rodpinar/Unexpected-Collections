# Perspective and Truth

If one looks at these images without knowing the history, one might think that Spain won the war. The majority of the trade cards depict the Spaniards at the forefront, in a dignified, and victorious way. Whereas the Cubans are presented in a rudimentary manner, without distinguishing features, always in the run, injured, or defeated, and racialized subjects. If we look at the language used in the description at the bottom of each card, we can notice a common pattern when it comes to referencing the Cuban rebels.

One word, in particular, is repeated throughout the cards, the word cabecilla (ringleader), which bears a demeaning connotation in Spanish and is used to equate the Cuban leaders with bandits.

Another diminishing word used to describe the rebels’ actions is *filibustero (filibuster)*. This type of language presented the idea that the war in Cuba was an affair of pillage, piracy, and bandits. 
Against this representation of the war, and keeping in mind that a ‘rudimentary’ enemy fought against Spain for ten years first, and then after a peace treaty and unfruitful strifes, the war began again for three more years, it is fascinating to consider how differently this war looked from the Cubans’ perspective. The Guerra Necesaria (1895-1898), as Cuba’s National Hero José Martí (1853-1895) baptized it, saw the remarkable organization of the Cubans inside and outside (mainly in the U.S) the island, the close collaboration with other Caribbean leaders, and the amazing fundraising for the financing of the war. 
Despite the biased portrayal of the war, a couple of truthful representations call our attention. First, the different places mentioned in the cards where the combats and military actions are taking place, and second, the presence of women among the Cuban rebels. On the one hand, these details confirm that the war engulfed the entire island, affecting every aspect of the economic, political, and social life, and pointing at the high levels of the strategy of the Cuban insurgents. On the other hand, the presence of women recognizes their role in anti-colonial politics, their active participation in the military, and the political wings of the independence movement.
