# Introduction
 
 The Spanish-American War (April-Dec1898) saw the clash of two imperial powers, one in decline, Spain, and the other in ascent, United States. Yet, what the name of that war failed to grasp was the fact that the war did not take place in either Spain or the United States. The absence of Cuba in the naming of the war points at the silencing of Cuba in its struggle for independence from Spain, and the role of propaganda in the engine of imperialism. 
Similar to the American press, the Spanish government used a propaganda machine to justify its cruelty and expensive wars in Cuba.  From the Ten Years War (1868-1878) and onwards, Spain used several smear campaigns to discredit the Cuban rebels (called mambises) and their claims for independence. Newspapers, political cartoons, and other forms of printed materials served that purpose. Such is the case of the Chocolates E. Juncosa Trade Cards, a series of 36 chromo trade cards from an unknown artist (or artists), depicting the Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898) and The Spanish-American War. The Spanish company Chocolates Juncosa ( also known as Fábrica de Chocolate de Evaristo Juncosa, Chocolate E. Juncosa, or just Chocolate Juncosa) produced these trade cards around 1910 after the war had ended and as a form of popular, collectible material accompanying its chocolates.

Using the process of color printing, known as chromolitography, these images document important battles, historical figures, places, and life in rural, military camps from Spain’s perspective. This exhibition provides an opportunity to tell the general public about the war from the Cuban and Caribbean’s standpoint. Using digital humanities methodologies and organized by thematic areas, the exhibition proposes a counter-narrative to the one presented in these chromo trade cards.
