 ## Introduction
 *Introduction*
 The Spanish-American War (April-Dec1898) saw the clash of two imperial powers, one in decline, Spain, and the other in ascent, United States. Yet, what the name of that war failed to grasp was the fact that the war did not take place in either Spain or the United States. The absence of Cuba in the naming of the war points at the silencing of Cuba in its struggle for independence from Spain, and the role of propaganda in the engine of imperialism. 
Similar to the American press, the Spanish government used a propaganda machine to justify its cruelty and expensive wars in Cuba.  From the Ten Years War (1868-1878) and onwards, Spain used several smear campaigns to discredit the Cuban rebels (called mambises) and their claims for independence. Newspapers, political cartoons, and other forms of printed materials served that purpose. Such is the case of the Chocolates E. Juncosa Trade Cards, a series of 36 chromo trade cards from an unknown artist (or artists), depicting the Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898) and The Spanish-American War. The Spanish company Chocolates Juncosa ( also known as Fábrica de Chocolate de Evaristo Juncosa, Chocolate E. Juncosa, or just Chocolate Juncosa) produced these trade cards around 1910 after the war had ended and as a form of popular, collectible material accompanying its chocolates.

Using the process of color printing, known as chromolitography, these images document important battles, historical figures, places, and life in rural, military camps from Spain’s perspective. This exhibition provides an opportunity to tell the general public about the war from the Cuban and Caribbean’s standpoint. Using digital humanities methodologies and organized by thematic areas, the exhibition proposes a counter-narrative to the one presented in these chromo trade cards.

## Perspective and Truth
*Perspective and Truth*
If one looks at these images without knowing the history, one might think that Spain won the war. The majority of the trade cards depict the Spaniards at the forefront, in a dignified, and victorious way. Whereas the Cubans are presented in a rudimentary manner, without distinguishing features, always in the run, injured, or defeated, and racialized subjects. If we look at the language used in the description at the bottom of each card, we can notice a common pattern when it comes to referencing the Cuban rebels.
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_018a" width="75" caption=false %}
One word, in particular, is repeated throughout the cards, the word cabecilla (ringleader), which bears a demeaning connotation in Spanish and is used to equate the Cuban leaders with bandits.

Another diminishing word used to describe the rebels’ actions is filibustero (filibuster). This type of language presented the idea that the war in Cuba was an affair of pillage, piracy, and bandits. 
Against this representation of the war, and keeping in mind that a ‘rudimentary’ enemy fought against Spain for ten years first, and then after a peace treaty and unfruitful strifes, the war began again for three more years, it is fascinating to consider how differently this war looked from the Cubans’ perspective. The Guerra Necesaria (1895-1898), as Cuba’s National Hero José Martí (1853-1895) baptized it, saw the remarkable organization of the Cubans inside and outside (mainly in the U.S) the island, the close collaboration with other Caribbean leaders, and the amazing fundraising for the financing of the war. 
Despite the biased portrayal of the war, a couple of truthful representations call our attention. First, the different places mentioned in the cards where the combats and military actions are taking place, and second, the presence of women among the Cuban rebels. On the one hand, these details confirm that the war engulfed the entire island, affecting every aspect of the economic, political, and social life, and pointing at the high levels of the strategy of the Cuban insurgents. On the other hand, the presence of women recognizes their role in anti-colonial politics, their active participation in the military, and the political wings of the independence movement.

## Pan-Caribbean Connections 
*Pan-Caribbean Connections*
The Spanish Empire considered Cuba its most precious possession in the Caribbean, not only for its strategic location but also for its sugar plantations. After the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) Cuba became the paragon of sugar production and a bastion of slavery and colonial rule. 
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_020a" width="50" caption=false %}

Given the importance of sugar in the colonial economy, Cuban insurgents (called mambises) burned many sugar cane fields and sugar mills along the island. This guerrilla tactic was also used in other Caribbean countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic before being adopted in Cuba.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_001a;juncosa_010a;juncosa_011a;juncosa_022a" width="50" caption=false %}
Máximo Gómez (1836-1905), a Dominican general and one of the most important leaders of the Cuban independence movement made this technique a cornerstone of his guerilla warfare style. Along with Gómez, Antonio Maceo (1848-1896), another leader and general in the rebel army, successfully deployed that tactic and the feared ‘machete charge’  against the Spaniards. 
The warfare tactics, the exchange of ideas, and the collaboration of leaders from several Caribbean countries (often located in different geographical locations) talk of the rich independence movement that irradiated from the Caribbean and its diaspora.
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_021a" width="50" caption=false %}
Another example of this Pan-Caribbean connection was the presence of Juan Rius Rivera (1848-1924), a Puerto Rican revolutionary leader, who fought along with Cubans and became a general in the rebel army. 
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_011a" width="50" caption=false %}
One of the Chocolates Juncosa’s trade cards portrays Rius Rivera, albeit we can’t distinguish him, being injured and captured by the Spaniards. This type of erasure and misrepresentation is repeated throughout the collection. The most problematic one is the number 10, in which we see the alleged deaths of Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo. The truth is that they died in different places and years apart from each other. Maceo died in combat on December 7th,1896 during a military campaign in the west part of Cuba while Gómez was in the eastern part of the island. His death was a heavy blow to the Cuban forces and a very personal one for Máximo Gómez. Francisco ‘Panchito’ Gómez Toro (1876-1896) was Maceo’s military aide-de-camp and Gómez’s son, who also died that day fighting next to Maceo.  
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_010a" width="50" caption=false %}
In his Diario de Campaña/Campaign Diary, Máximo Gómez describes December 16th, 1896 as “El dia mas triste para mi''/the saddest day for me (p.315), a reference to the date when he receives the news of his son and Maceo’s death.  What makes this quotation relevant is how perfectly it illustrates the personal toll of the war and provides us with a more human perspective of a heroic figure. 
In many ways, Maceo’s death became a theme of symbolic reference in the Cuban imagination. After the birth of the Cuban Republic in 1902, the artist and former independence fighter Armando Garcia Menocal (1863-1942) painted La muerte de Maceo/ The death of Maceo  in 1906. Menocal’s masterpiece serves as a visual and symbolic counterpoint to the portrayal of Maceo’s death in the Chocolates Juncosa collection.

## Selling a War
*Selling a War*
“Remember the Maine! And don’t forget the starving Cubans!” and “Remember the Maine--to hell with Spain!” were common rallying cries in American newspapers, political cartoons, and magazines in the aftermath of the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor, on February 15th, 1898. Newspapers tycoons and publishers William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer quickly accused Spain of the sinking and set in motion the public opinion in favor of military intervention. Many of those newspapers and political cartoons failed to mention that the USS Maine’s mission in Cuba, was neither altruistic nor unsolicited, its mission was to safeguard American property and investments during the Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898). Such a heavy military presence in Havana Harbor not only ensured the protection of the American economic interests but also materialized the Monroe Doctrine and propelled the role of the United States as a world power.

On April 23rd,1898 President William McKinley (1843-1901) issued a call for 125,000 volunteers to join the army. This allowed for the nationalization of the Texas Volunteer Guard. Although the Texas Volunteers did not make it to Cuba ( Texas Volunteers List with link/map here ), Texas provided the place for training the famous voluntary cavalry regiment the “Rough Riders”. Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) and Colonel Leonard Wood (1860-1927) (future Military Governor of Cuba from 1899-1902) trained their unit in San Antonio, Texas, and after that, they were allowed to sail for Santiago de Cuba on June 13th, 1898.  
The last trade cards in the Chocolates Juncosa collection (chromos 29-36) depict the American involvement in the war, mainly in the eastern part of Cuba. This part of the island endured the brunt of the war and saw the sinking of the Spanish fleet in Santiago de Cuba’s harbor on July 3rd, 1898. However, these images present an undisputed version of the Spanish fleet and a sinking American ship in Santiago’s harbor.
{% include feature/image.html objectid="juncosa_033a" width="50" caption=false %}
These visual references leave us with a crucial observation: the absence of the Cuban forces. It is as if the island’s only purpose is to be the battleground of the war. This point is especially important because it reminds us of the American arrogance in denying the victorious entrance of Calixto García’s troops in Santiago de Cuba. In fact, General Calixto García (1836-1898) provided the strategic support and intel for the American troops to successfully land in the Oriente Province (eastern Cuba). That brings us to the Treaty of Paris, a treaty that in many respects saw the birth of a new Empire and how imperialist forces weave a narrative of erasure
